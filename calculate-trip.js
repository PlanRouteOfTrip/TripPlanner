//we have 
//startPoint = {}
//places = [{}, {}, ...]
//finishPoint = {}
//totalTripTime = number in mins

//1. For each place from places calculate time from startPoint to this place,
//add place.timeFromStart: time if (timeFromStart + timeToSpend) < totalTripTime
//else remove place from places
//2. For each place from places calculate time to finishPoint from this place,
//add place.timeToFinish: time if (timeFromStart + timeToSpend + timeToFinish) < totalTripTime
//else remove place from places
//3. Fill out travelTimes matrix for remaining places
//4. Calculate all possible trips
//5. Get trips within total trip time
